# Accounting
This program is runned by openpyxl and the main goal of this is to enter a transaction and all related information to be updated. 

So it will go like this: Journal entry -> General Ledger -> Trial Balance -> Adjusted Trial Balance -> Closing Statements

I also want to make a mode Balance to give you the balance of each account. 

All transaction related mechanisms will be in transaction.py
Any other programs will be made in a seperate python file, ex. balance.py

To run, run the main.py file. This file imports these seperate python programs and run their method. 

This will take a while to develop and program so please feel free to contribute
